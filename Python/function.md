# Declaring a function
Often enough, built-in functions cannot suffice even beginners. In such a case, there is no choice but to create your own function using the keyword `def` (right, derived from define). Let's have a look at the syntax:
```python
def function_name(parameter1, parameter2, ...):
    # function's body
    ...
    return "return value"
```
