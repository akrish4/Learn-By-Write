# Boolean type
The Boolean type, or simply bool, is a special data type that has only two possible values: True and False. In Python the names of boolean values start with a capital letter.

In programming languages the boolean, or logical, type is a common way to represent something that has only two opposite states like on or off, yes or no, etc.

If you are writing an application that keeps track of door openings, you'll find it natural to use bool to store the current door state.
     
     is_open = True
     is_closed = False

     print(is_open)    # True
     print(is_closed)  # False
# Boolean operations
