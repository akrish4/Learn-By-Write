# Comparison operators
Comparison or relation operations let you compare two values and determine the relation between them. There are ten comparison operators in Python:
- `<` strictly less than
- `<=` less than or equal
- `>` strictly greater than
- `>=` greater than or equal
- `==` equal
- `!=` not equal
- `is` object identity
- `is not` negated object identity
- `in` membership
- `not in` negated membership

The result of applying these operators is always bool.
# Comparing integers
