# Comments
In HTML files, you can write a special text which the browser will ignore when opening the file. Such text is called a comment. Why write it if in the end it is simply and deliberately ignored? It actually makes a lot of sense to use comments during the process of development as they can greatly improve the readability of the code.

A comment in HTML code can be generally defined as follows:

```
<!-- Any text -->
```
