# Comments
In HTML files, you can write a special text which the browser will ignore when opening the file. Such text is called a comment. Why write it if in the end it is simply and deliberately ignored? It actually makes a lot of sense to use comments during the process of development as they can greatly improve the readability of the code.

A comment in HTML code can be generally defined as follows:


```
<!-- Any text -->
```
Any text placed in <!-- and --> will be considered a comment. The text of the comment can be placed either on a single line or several
`Comments can be used anywhere on the page except the <title> tag.`

# One-line comments
Comments that occupy one line are called one-line comments. Take a careful look at the syntactic features of one-line comments:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>One-line comments</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- It's a one-line comment -->
    <p>It's a paragraph of the text</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

The result in the browser will look as follows:
